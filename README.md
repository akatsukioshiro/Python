# Python
So, I started learning Python on 9:00am on 27 June 2018. 
=============================PROJECT 1=============================================
"Login-Pass.py" program was created/completed between 9:00am and 2:30pm on 27 June 2018. 
Login-Pass.py is a shell based program that accepts id,pass and stores them in text files.
It is a simple file handling program.
=============================PROJECT 2=============================================
"Tkinter-Phonebook.py" program was created/completed between 9:00am and 3:15pm on 28 June 2018.
It is a Tkinter Python library based GUI based application with buttons etc
It can create a text file to store,update,delete names and phonenumbers.
If phonebook is newly opened and has no numbers, it can also load the whole phonebook.txt file.
